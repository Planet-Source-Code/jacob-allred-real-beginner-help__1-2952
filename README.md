```
' To center a form quickly and easily, find the picture of
' your form in the box in the lower right-hand corner of the
' screen, right click on it, go to Startup Position, and
' choose Center Screen. Now no matter what resolution they
' use, it is in the center of the screen.
'
' In the Menu Editor (Tools... Menu Editor OR Ctrl-E), if you
' make the caption of one of the options " - " (without
' quotes or space) it will add a horizantal line in the menu
' in that position.
'
' To keep from accidentally moving stuff you already have
' where you want it, go to Format... Lock Controls. That will
' keep anything from moving.
'
' Go to the Project Explorer window (ctrl-r). Right click and
' go to Project1 Properties. Click on the Make tab. Now you
' can change Copyright, program Title, version, Company, ect.
'
' If you need more help, ask people! Leave feedback here and
' I will get back to you and add it into this "help file"! Look
' in the help file (Help.. Microsoft Visual Basic Help Topics).
' Most people are happy to help other people, so just ask.
